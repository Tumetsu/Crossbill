def compute_book_hash(title: str, author: str | None, description: str | None = None) -> str:
    """
    Compute a unique hash for a book based on its title, author, and description.

    This hash is used for deduplication during book uploads. The hash is computed
    from the book title, author (if present), and description (if present). This
    allows the book metadata to be edited later without breaking deduplication -
    the original hash is preserved and used to identify the same book on subsequent uploads.

    Args:
        title: The title of the book
        author: The author of the book (can be None)
        description: The description of the book (can be None)
