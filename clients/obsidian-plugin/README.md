## Prerequisites

### Backend CORS Configuration

The Crossbill backend must allow CORS requests from the Obsidian plugin. By default, the backend allows all origins (`*`), which works for desktop applications like Obsidian.

If you need to restrict CORS origins, set the `CORS_ORIGINS` environment variable in your backend:

```bash
# In backend/.env or as environment variable
CORS_ORIGINS=*  # Allow all origins (default, recommended for Obsidian)

# Or specify multiple origins (comma-separated):
# CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:8000,app://obsidian.md
```

After changing CORS settings, restart your Crossbill backend server.

## Configuration

Before using the plugin, you need to configure your Crossbill server:

1. Open Settings → Crossbill
2. Set the "Server Host" to your Crossbill server URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`)
3. Save settings

## Usage

The plugin provides two commands for importing highlights:

### Import highlights from a chapter

Import highlights from a single chapter of a book:

1. Open a note where you want to import highlights
2. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd + P)
3. Search for "Import highlights from a chapter"
4. Choose a book from the list
5. Choose a chapter from the book
6. The highlights will be inserted at your cursor position

### Import all highlights from a book

Import all highlights from all chapters of a book:

1. Open a note where you want to import highlights
2. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd + P)
3. Search for "Import all highlights from a book"
4. Choose a book from the list
5. All chapters and their highlights will be inserted at your cursor position

## Highlight Format

Highlights are imported in the following format:

```markdown
## Book Title

**Author:** Author Name

### Chapter Name

> Highlighted text here

**Note:** Any notes you made on the highlight

_Page 42_

---

> Another highlight...

---
```

When importing all chapters, each chapter is formatted as a level 3 heading (###) with all its highlights below.
