2. Locate your Anki add-ons directory:
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Anki2\addons21\`
   - **Mac**: `~/Library/Application Support/Anki2/addons21/`
   - **Linux**: `~/.local/share/Anki2/addons21/`

3. Create a symbolic link or copy the plugin folder:
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Symbolic link (recommended for development)
   ln -s /path/to/Crossbill/clients/anki-plugin /path/to/Anki2/addons21/crossbill

   # Option 2: Copy the folder
   cp -r /path/to/Crossbill/clients/anki-plugin /path/to/Anki2/addons21/crossbill
   ```

4. Restart Anki

5. The plugin should appear in Tools → Add-ons

### From AnkiWeb (Future)

Once published to AnkiWeb:
1. Open Anki → Tools → Add-ons → Get Add-ons
2. Enter the add-on code
3. Restart Anki

## Configuration

### Initial Setup

1. In Anki, go to **Tools → Crossbill Settings**
2. Enter your Crossbill server URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`)
3. Click **Test Connection** to verify it works
4. Click **Save**

### Configuration Options

Edit configuration via **Tools → Add-ons → Crossbill → Config**:

- **server_host**: URL of your Crossbill server
- **default_deck**: Default Anki deck for imported notes
- **default_note_type**: Default note type to use (e.g., "Basic")
- **auto_tag**: Automatically add tags to imported notes
- **tag_prefix**: Prefix for auto-generated tags (default: "crossbill")

See [config.md](config.md) for detailed configuration documentation.

## Usage

### Browse Highlights

1. Go to **Tools → Browse Crossbill Highlights**
2. Select a book from the books list at the top
3. Browse highlights in the middle section
4. Click on a highlight to see full details in the bottom section

### Search and Filter Highlights

1. Select a book to load its highlights
2. Use the **Search** box to filter highlights by text (searches highlight text and your notes)
3. Use the **Tag** dropdown to filter by specific tags
4. Use the **Chapter** dropdown to filter by chapter
5. Click **Clear Filters** to reset all filters
6. Status bar shows filtered count (e.g., "Showing 5 of 20 highlights (filtered)")

**Tips:**
- Filters work together (search AND tag AND chapter)
- Search is case-insensitive
- Filters persist until you change books or clear them

### Create Flashcards (Individual Import)

1. Open the highlights browser (**Tools → Browse Crossbill Highlights**)
2. Select a book to see its highlights
3. (Optional) Use search/filters to find specific highlights
4. Use checkboxes to select highlights you want to import:
   - Click individual checkboxes, or
   - Use "Select All" to select all (currently visible) highlights, or
   - Use "Deselect All" to clear selections
5. Choose your target **Deck** from the dropdown
6. Choose your **Note Type** (e.g., "Basic", "Basic (and reversed card)")
7. Click **Import Selected**
8. Confirm the import
9. Wait for the import to complete (progress dialog will show)

### Batch Import

Import many highlights at once without selecting them individually:

**Import All from Book:**
1. Select a book
2. Choose your **Deck** and **Note Type**
3. Click **Import All from Book**
4. Review the confirmation (shows new vs already imported counts)
5. Click "Yes" to import all highlights from the book

**Import All from Chapter:**
1. Select a book
2. Select a chapter from the **Chapter** filter dropdown
3. Choose your **Deck** and **Note Type**
4. Click **Import All from Chapter**
5. Review the confirmation
6. Click "Yes" to import all highlights from that chapter

**Notes:**
- Already imported highlights are marked with "✓ Imported" and grayed out
- Duplicate detection prevents re-importing the same highlight
- Each highlight creates one note with:
  - **Front**: The highlight text
  - **Back**: Book title, author, chapter, page, and your notes
- Tags are automatically added (book name, author, Crossbill tags)
- You can import to any deck and use any note type in your collection
- Batch import shows progress dialog and detailed statistics

## Prerequisites

### Crossbill Server

You need a running Crossbill server with highlights. The server must be accessible from your computer where Anki is installed.

### CORS Configuration

The Crossbill backend must allow CORS requests from Anki. By default, the backend allows all origins (`*`), which works for desktop applications.

If you need to restrict CORS:
```bash
# In backend/.env
CORS_ORIGINS=*  # Recommended for desktop apps
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to connect to server"

1. Check that your Crossbill server is running
2. Verify the server URL in settings (include `http://` or `https://`)
3. Check firewall settings
4. Try the **Test Connection** button in settings

### "No books found"

1. Make sure you have books with highlights in your Crossbill library
2. Check that the API endpoints are working:
   - `http://your-server:8000/api/v1/highlights/books`
3. Check server logs for errors

### Plugin doesn't appear in Anki

1. Verify the plugin is in the correct add-ons directory
2. Check the folder name is `crossbill`
3. Restart Anki completely
4. Check **Tools → Add-ons** for error messages

### Import errors (for development)

If you see Python import errors:
1. Make sure all `.py` files are in the plugin directory
2. Check that `__init__.py` exists in the plugin root and `ui/` folder
3. Restart Anki to reload the plugin
